- 👋  &nbsp; Hi, I’m @thejoshcrawford
- 👀  &nbsp; I’m a jack of all trades and am interested in all things crypto, but searching for a specialty. 
- 🌱  &nbsp; I’m currently learning general defi and nft ins and outs. I'm building my own dapp to try to cross the chasm of YouTube tutorials to real commercial projects. 
- 💞️  &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate on defi projects. 
- 📫  &nbsp; You can reach me at josh@crawford.cc
